Fiberglass shingles do contain some asphalt, but less of it than organic shingles. The mat is soaked with asphalt filled with mineral fillers, which makes it waterproof. Due to the absence of paper, fiberglass shingles are more fire resistant than organic asphalt shingles. They are also environmentally friendly; they even contain cedar wood shavings and other materials that protect them from UV degradation. These high quality products can easily last as long as 20 to 50 years. Contact the experts at Ninja Roofing to help you select the right shingles for your home.</p>
